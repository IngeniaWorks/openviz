# Local Development

## Docker-first setup

The recommended path is:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts the application, PostgreSQL, and Redis and runs the setup flow. Use `pnpm run docker:logs` to inspect services and `pnpm run docker:down` to stop them.

## Host setup

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
pnpm run setup
pnpm run dev
```

The setup command validates configuration, prepares the database, and seeds local defaults. `pnpm run dev` starts PostgreSQL and Redis through Docker, then starts Next.js and the collaboration WebSocket server. See [environment variables](../operations/environment-variables.md) for configuration guidance.

If Next.js or the collaboration server is already listening on its configured port, the dev launcher checks the listener's working directory before reusing it. A listener from another project is left untouched and OpenViz automatically uses the next available port. Set `OPENVIZ_PORT_CONFLICT=error` to fail instead. You can select alternate ports with `PORT` and `COLLAB_PORT`.

## ComfyUI

ComfyUI is optional for mock generation. For local AI generation, start it on the configured endpoint and install the required checkpoint and ControlNet models in the corresponding ComfyUI model directories.
